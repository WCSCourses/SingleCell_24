# Single Cell Genomics- LAC: 9 to 16 August 2024

## Course Overview

Single-cell sequencing technologies are powerful tools used to assess genomic, transcriptomic and proteomics information at the single-cell level. In recent years, the application of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methodologies has become increasingly common across diverse fields of life sciences research. In medicine, single-cell approaches used to investigate organisms in both health and disease conditions have advanced unprecedented understanding of organisms’ biology as a whole. 

Successful scientific networks promoted by the Human Cells Atlas consortium highlighted the growing interest among scientists and an urgent need for developing capacity in single-cell technologies worldwide. However, there is still a lack of infrastructure, limited funding, and insufficient expertise to apply these cutting-edge technologies in Latin America. 

Aiming to expand the region’s capacity, our short course will offer hands-on laboratory and bioinformatics analysis training, tailored to empower researchers in Latin America with essential skills to employ single-cell technologies.

Following our successful first edition, this course will mark a revised second version, reflecting the high demand and positive feedback received previously. Building on the foundation laid by the inaugural course, we aim to delve deeper into the realm of single-cell technologies. This time, we are dedicated to exploring a broader spectrum of cutting-edge methodologies. These advancements promise to further enhance the capacity of researchers in Latin America, equipping them with the knowledge and skills needed to leverage the full potential of single-cell technologies in their scientific endeavours.
